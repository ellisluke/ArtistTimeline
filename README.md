# Artist Timeline
As part of another 24-hour personal challenge, I built a prototype to visualize a musical artist's history. This project pulls in data from Spotify and Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash to build a scrollable timeline chronicling the artist's major releases accompanied with descriptions of the album.
